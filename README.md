# Authorship_Attribution_R

This study aims to classify the author of a given text accurately. This corpus contains 10 bloggers with 500 data points each, where one data point contains 400-1500 words. Data was collected through web-scraping 10 individual blogs covering topics related to venture capital, technology, and entrepreneurship. In this corpus, several standard stylometric variables were calculated, including word length, vocabulary diversity, word frequency, and n-grams, including bigrams and trigrams. A Na√Øve Bayes classifier algorithm was trained on the data set together with TF-IDF as a feature selection method, resulting in an accuracy of 82.6%.
